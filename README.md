# Toy Monte Carlo for UNCG combinatorics research

## These are the main files and directories for this project

File name | description
--------- | -----------
RanGenX.C | 2,4,6,8 particle Monte Carlo, spacing set to a small value to generate the 2nd harmonic for all correlators
RanGen2X.C | 2,4,6,8 particle Monte Carlo, spacing set to 2pi/k to generate k-th harmonic for k-th correlator
RanGen2B.C | 2,4,6,8 particle Binary correlator, identically matches pure combinatorial expectations
rnghistX.C | Plots the ouput from RanGenX.C
rnghistXR.C | Similar to rnghistX.C but for experimenting with different functional forms
rnghist2X.C | Plots the output from RanGen2X.C
